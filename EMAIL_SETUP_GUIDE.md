# 📧 Contact Form Email Setup - Simple Guide

## ✅ Your Current Setup
Your contact form is now configured to use **Formspree** - a reliable, free email service.

## 🚀 How to Get Emails from Your Contact Form

### Step 1: Create Formspree Account
1. **Go to:** https://formspree.io/
2. **Click:** "Get Started" button
3. **Sign up** with your email: `thushiniakashi58@gmail.com`
4. **Verify** your email address

### Step 2: Create a New Form
1. **Login** to your Formspree dashboard
2. **Click:** "New Form" button
3. **Form Name:** Portfolio Contact Form
4. **Your Email:** thushiniakashi58@gmail.com (where you want to receive messages)
5. **Click:** "Create Form"

### Step 3: Get Your Form Endpoint
After creating the form, you'll get a **Form Endpoint** that looks like:
```
https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
```

### Step 4: Update Your Portfolio Code
Replace the current Formspree URL in your code:

**Find this line in your Homepage.tsx:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/xpwzgnbp', {
```

**Replace with your new form endpoint:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_NEW_FORM_ID', {
```

### Step 5: Test Your Contact Form
1. **Fill out** your contact form on your website
2. **Submit** the message
3. **Check your email** (thushiniakashi58@gmail.com)
4. **Also check spam folder** (first few emails might go there)
